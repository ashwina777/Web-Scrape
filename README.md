# Web-Scrape
This repository contains the work I've done as part of the Data Science Master's course by PwSkills, with personal variations on Selenium(for web scraping). The main focus of this project is collecting data from websites, and it includes tasks such as scraping reviews, ratings and reviewer's name.
